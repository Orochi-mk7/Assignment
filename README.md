NSL-KDD Dataset Analysis for Intrusion Detection
Introduction
This README provides a step-by-step guide on how I conducted the analysis of the NSL-KDD dataset, with a focus on intrusion detection. The NSL-KDD dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating intrusion detection systems in network security.

Step 1: Data Loading
I began the analysis by loading the NSL-KDD dataset. In this step, I read the dataset from the 'KDDTrain+.txt' file using the Pandas library. The dataset contains a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes, which are essential for developing machine learning models.

Step 2: Missing Value Handling
Data quality is essential for accurate analysis. In this step, I handled missing values by filling them with the mean value of their respective columns. This ensures that I have complete data to work with.

Step 3: Duplicate Record Check
To maintain data integrity, I checked for duplicate records. Duplicate records, if found, were either retained or removed, depending on their relevance to the analysis.

Step 4: Categorical Data Encoding
To work with categorical data, I encoded them using one-hot encoding. Specifically, I encoded the 'protocol_type' column, which contains categorical values, into binary values for machine learning model compatibility.

Step 5: Standardizing Numeric Features
To ensure that each feature contributes proportionally during Principal Component Analysis (PCA), I standardized the numeric features. This step prevents biases in the results and facilitates meaningful interpretation.

Step 6: Feature Selection
Feature selection is crucial to identify the most relevant features for the analysis. I used the chi-squared (χ²) method, ideal for categorical features, to select the most discriminative features. This reduces dimensionality, improving manageability and accuracy.

Step 7: Creating New Features
Intrusion detection often requires the creation of new features that provide deeper insights. In this step, I created a new feature called 'failed_login_attempts' by combining relevant features, enhancing the dataset's informativeness.

Step 8: Visualization and Analysis
The analysis included data visualization, PCA, and correlation analysis. I created visualizations in the principal component space, explored data clusters, and analyzed the semantic meaning of each principal component to gain deeper insights into data patterns.

Step 9: Conclusion and Applications
I concluded the analysis by summarizing key takeaways and discussing the practical applications of the analysis in cybersecurity and intrusion detection.
